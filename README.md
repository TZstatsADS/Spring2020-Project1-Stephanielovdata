### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: What Lyrics Say
+ This project is conducted by [Guoying Li]

+ Project summary: In this project, I am interested in exploring the connection between the music and our lives by answering these questions: which are the words you hear the most while listening to music? In different genres, which are the most used words? Which genres is the word "love" most used?  I tried to answer them by using lyrics databases and analyzing them with Rstudio.I analyse the lyrics based on various lyrics and find the trend of word usage by ggplot and wordcloud. In lyrics datasets, there are 10 types of genres of music: which are: country, eletronic, folk, hip-hop, indie, Jazz, Metal, Pop, R&B, and Rock. I focus on the genres including: Electronic, Hip-Hop, Rock, Metal, and Country.
